# Push After Changes

After adding or modifying code in this project:

1. **Stage** all relevant changes: `git add` (files you changed, or `git add -A` for the session’s work).
2. **Commit** with a clear message: `git commit -m "Brief description of what was done"`.
3. **Push** to the remote: `git push`.

Do this at the end of the session whenever you have made edits, so the repo is always up to date.
