# Push After Changes

**Always push. Always verify. If it fails, fix it automatically.**

After adding or modifying code in this project:

1. **Stage** all relevant changes: `git add` (files you changed, or `git add -A` for the session's work).
2. **Commit** with a clear message: `git commit -m "Brief description of what was done"`.
3. **Push** to the remote: `git push`.
4. **Verify** the push succeeded (check exit code; run `git status` if needed).
5. **If push fails**: fix it automatically, then push again until successful.
   - If remote has new commits: `git pull --rebase` (or `git pull`) then `git push`.
   - If auth issues: user must fix credentials; retry push after.
   - Resolve conflicts if needed, then push.

Do this at the end of every session whenever you have made edits. Never leave without a successful push.
